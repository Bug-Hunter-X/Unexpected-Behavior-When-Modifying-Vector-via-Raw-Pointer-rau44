This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when dealing with raw pointers and vectors.  The `bug.rs` file shows code that attempts to modify a vector using a raw pointer without proper care. This can result in undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer and more idiomatic Rust approach to achieve the same result, avoiding potential issues associated with raw pointers.
